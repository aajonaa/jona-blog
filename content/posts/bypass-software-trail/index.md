## How did I bypass or reset the software trail
### Background
I have my magic mouse, magic trackpad, and my magic keyboard, for the convinience, I use them in my newly installed windows. After a long time searching, I have found a good software which helps me to use those device in windows like I am using a Mac, this means I have all the abilities that those device have had in a MacOS. And this software is called [Magic Utilities](https://magicutilities.net/).

However, there are only 28 days trail for using. After the trail ended, I have tried the a open-source software called [mac-precision-touchpad](https://github.com/imbushuo/mac-precision-touchpad), which indeed make the touchpad a little bit more useful in a windows OS. While there is way to compare with the Magic Utilities. What's worse, I can not scroll by this mouse. The only one that I can use is the magic keyboard.

Those days, my girlfriend bought me a new mouse, which is really efficient to use during work. And most of the time, I bring it to my office. After work, I bought it home. There is sometime I may forget to bring, so I want to find a way to fix the trail problem.
